Hi! So for my first post I'd like to go a bit more into the fonts I used for my new website. This font is (or rather as of today, 25th DEC 2024 *was*) named Berkeley Mono TX-01. It has since been updated into a new major version - the Berkeley Mono ``TX-02`` font.


# Font description
The font is trying to emulate 80's aesthetics with a clear and good legibility. I absolutely love the way numbers look, as well as it's included ligature support for the majority of programming languages, including Haskell. It also includes a fairly wide language support, including Czech and Slovak, which I appreciate.


# What's new in 2.0?
The 2.0 version seems to be sleeker and proportions seem to look better overall, including many special symbols. The font seems to be slightly crispier. Quotes seem to be slightly shorter in the newer version vertical length wise. In any case, you can see a small demo of some of the ligatures here on my website:

```=> !== != ->> -> $> >= <= === /// // abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 '""'```

It appears the font is also a bit better with ligatures overall.

Aside from the obvious improvements, the price also went up, quite steeply so. The original developer license cost $75 and included variable fonts (altho a bit broken I admit), classic desktop fonts in all different sorts of thicknesses and webfonts in both `woff` and `woff2` formats.

The new font got split into more parts now. It's got modules:
- **Developer font ($75)**
- **Standard font (included with license)** - includes normal (100), regular (400) and bold (700) font variants and 2 slants - 0 and -16.
- **Master fonts ($75)** - includes condensed varaints (100 through 60) and boldness 100 through 900 (incremented by 100) with 350 also being a special value, and slanted values.
- **Web fonts ($45)** - includes the `woff` and `woff2` fonts with a license to use on your personal blog.
- **Ligatures ($20)** - includes the ligature version of the fonts (must have IMO).
- **Variable fonts ($25)** - allows you to download a single version of either a web of desktop fonts that includes every variant.
- **SuperType Compiler ($45)** - allows you to compile the font to your liking - includes a choice of variants for the `|` and `r` characters.

WHOA! Yeah thats a LOT of new options that were previously included! The original license holders get access to the Developer font, Master font, Ligatures and Standard compilers. However, you **lose access to the web font and variable fonts that you need to re-purchase)**. 

The font being so great, I can chew through the price, but it will now cost you a total of $285 to get the full package! That is quite a lot. Most of the modules you will need.

# Why not Jetbrains-Mono?
The [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font is a free font that looks similair to TX-02 Berkeley Mono font, but has better language support, and is **completely free even for commercial use** (you have to pay extra for a special license with Berkeley Mono). Personally though, the design of TX-02 looks so much so better that I am able to justify the price. 


# What else is there?
There are more fonts in the works. I can't wait to see them all, but for me, until the forseeable future, Berkeley Mono is the font to use. I use it while coding in Helix, and as my main monospace font. IMO it's worth the price, but if you can't afford it, just get the Jetbrains Mono font (which is included automatically in [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) - the best terminal emulator ever!).

In the meantime, you can enjoy some source code of things I write on my website - all in the TX-02 Berkeley Mono font. That should help you decide whether it's worth it.
