So I've decided to write a blog. This page will summarize my experiences with various technologies, my annoyances and other things I find annoying but hope that hopefully can resonate with someone.


# Who am I
I am a 26 year old medior developer that programs in React/Typescript and loves to use Rust, works with TypeScript and Go and is dabbing into Haskell.

# Where to contact me
If you wish to contact me, you can do so using GitHub (links on the right side of the page).
